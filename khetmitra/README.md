### 🧩 Project Architecture & Code Flow

→ `src/` acts as the core of the application containing all business logic and UI  
→ `pages/` handles complete feature-level screens like Dashboard, Crop, Weather, and Diagnosis  
→ `components/` contains reusable UI elements such as cards, widgets, navbar, and footer  
→ `context/` manages global state and user-related data across the app  
→ `hooks/` abstracts API calls, authentication, and custom business logic  
→ `assets/` stores images, icons, and media files for consistent UI rendering  

→ This structured flow ensures a deeply connected, scalable, and maintainable KhetMitra UI
